## This App downloads weather data using a python Flask API and then displays a next.js based React component with the weather data

The two directories separate the API and the Map component:

### `python-radar-server`

This is the python API that downloads and processes the radar data

### `radap-app`

This is the next.js/React component that displays the map and weather data
