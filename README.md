## This App downloads weather data using a python Flask API and then displays a next.js based React component with the weather data

The two directories separate the API and the Map component:

### `python-radar-server`

This is the python API that downloads and processes

### `radap-app` (coming soon)

This is the next.js/React component that will display the map and weather data
